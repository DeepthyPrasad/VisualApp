# VisualApp
The project was to build a data visualisation - android application for mobile devices
with its version more than Android 11.0. It enables the user to view as well as customise
the information based on their interest in viewing the data. Dataset being viewed on the
app is from the year 2014-2020 on how the housing market has changed w.r.t certain
parameters like monthly rent, builders, region and apartment type. Also, users can get
to know the major affecting factors for the rent in a particular region or for a particular
type of apartment.
